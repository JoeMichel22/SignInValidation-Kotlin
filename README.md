# SignInValidation-Kotlin
This app is a simple sign in form that takes user input for name, password, and a chosen major. The user must enter their password twice to "confirm" their idenity. If all of the inputs are entered correctly then their name will be displayed in the TextView heading, if not the appropriate error message will be displayed.
